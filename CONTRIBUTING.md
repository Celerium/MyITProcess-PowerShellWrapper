# How to contribute to this module

## **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Celerium/MyITProcess-PowerShellWrapper/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Celerium/MyITProcess-PowerShellWrapper/issues/new).
  * Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request (PR) with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Please update the ModuleVersion using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) in the MyITProcessAPI.psd1 file.  Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH:

  * MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
  * MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
  * PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

## **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change by creating a GitHub issue tagged with "Enhancement"

* Create a branch and start working on your new feature, following feedback from the community.

* Once the new feature is ready, submit a pull request. If the feature is accepted and I have time to test, the pull request will be approved.

Thanks! :heart:
